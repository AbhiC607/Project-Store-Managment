# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

Write a description of your project here. Include what your store you made, and why you chose this topic. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain how you represented the item/service from your store. If you have user input, explain how the user will interact with your store such as which questions are prompted to the user, what response is your program expecting, and how that is use to output information for your store in the console.

My project was originally going to be a restaurant but Mr Aiello suggested it could be a photography studio instead, I liked this idea and I made my UML diagram based on it being a photography studio, we would offer portrait, photography and event photography both with different costs and different questions that go alongside them. When I started working on the code I had to get help from a friend who took comp sci A, I decided to switch back to my original idea of being a restaurant to make it easier for both of us to understand, whenever something was wrong in my code I would ask him to look at it and he was able to help me troubleshoot which would have been difficult for me to understand because I don't really understand the error messages I get. The way the program works is you're prompted with your order which is pizza, pasta then sushi (which I thought would be funny that it's Italian food and then randomly sushi) you are asked what kind of pizza you want then what kind of pasta you want then what kind of fish on your sushi you want. You are also asked if you want cheese sprinkled on your pasta, and what sauce you want with your sushi and how much sushi you want. You are then given your receipt which includes all the information you provided as well as the prices.
